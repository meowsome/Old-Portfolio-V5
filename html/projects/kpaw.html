        <p class="project-summary">This is a small hub-like page I made for Preston Middle School's KPAW program. It's quite simple, presenting 3 buttons that lead to the 3 main parts of the program. I tried to make the site "fun" to use and look at, since it was built for an audience of middle-schoolers.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"><i>I wanted to make the website fast and efficient to navigate and to have a fun look.</i></p><br>
            <p>This was a website I designed for Preston Middle School's KPAW program. It was not requested or commissioned, I voluntarily designed it for no charge. In this site, I experimented with the placement of divs, the use of color schemes, and things of the sort. Since the site will be used mostly by kids attending the middle school, I tried to use the school's color scheme in a "playful" fashion so that it is appealing to the students. I feel that the website is very basic and simple, but it does what it is supposed to do.</p>
