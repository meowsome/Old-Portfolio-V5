            <h3>Development Process</h3><br>
            <p class="subtitle"><i>I experimented with JavaScript by creating a simple Discord bot.</i></p><br>
            <p>I learned lots about using JavaScript in the creation of this bot, about about what all goes in to creating a bot for Discord as well. This bot features many different things, including fact searching, playing music, showing user information, showing weather, and more as well. It even has its own website! I received lots of technical help from <a href="http://bucketmuncher.vulpix.pw" target="_blank">BucketMuncher</a> for the code, but I still feel that I learned quite a bit. If you have a Discord server, you can invite it to your server right now if you want!</p>
