        <p class="project-summary">This website was built for Sudeep Pasricha's EPiC Lab at Colorado State University. This was my first time working with Wordpress. Through creating this website, I was able to learn the basics of Wordpress, Drupal, PHP, and MAMP.</p>

            <h3>Development Process</h3><br>
            <p class="subtitle"><i>I needed to transfer all of the content from the old site to the new one, and allow for a way to easily log in and edit content.</i></p><br>
            <p>In order to begin coding this website, I needed to find a way to allow Dr. Pasricha to edit the content without having to do any coding. After doing a bit of research on content management systems, I finally decided on Wordpress. The original candidates were Drupal and Wordpress, but I ultimately decided on Wordpress because I felt that it had more capabillities. It was a big learning curve for me, since I had to learn MAMP, the basics of PHP, and the components of Wordpress by myself. After a long amount of hours, I was able to produce a website for his lab using a custom theme for Wordpress.</p>
