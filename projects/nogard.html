            <h3>Development Process</h3><br>
            <p class="subtitle"><i>The website shows different aspects of the Nogard Minecraft server. It needed to be easy to navigate and fairly simple with the content.</i></p><br>
            <p>This website shows all of the different aspects of my Minecraft server, Nogard. It contains many new things that I learned in the process of creating the site, such as having the header/footer hosted on another page, using iframes, having divs side-by-side, and more. This site was also my first attempt at working with APIs, which you can see the results on the "Status". I feel that the website looks very nice and serves its purpose well, but could use a little updating (inclusion of the forum and store pages within the actual site, etc.).</p>
