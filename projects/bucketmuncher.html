            <p class="subtitle"><i>I gave BucketMuncher's old website a new look.</i></p><br>
            <p>This website is a very basic portfolio website built for my friend, BucketMuncher. I had made him a site in the past, and this page took all of the new knowledge I had at the time and utilized that in the site. I experimented with the placement of backgrounds and images on this site. On the main page, I made the background a drawing that BucketMuncher had made and put it next to his bio. On the Builds and Art pages, I was able to create a way to make the images zoom in when you click on them. I used a library for the animations.</p>
