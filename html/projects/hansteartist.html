            <p class="subtitle"><i>I took what knowledge I already had as well as new knowledge and merged those together in this website.</i></p><br>
            <p>This was a website that I built for Hansteartist on Instagram. My main goal was to try and learn a few new things about the coding languages I already knew, and to make the website look generally decent. While creating this website, I learned how to generate a random image from a list of images, effectively use radial gradients, make a loading animation that shows up when you first load the site, use fixed and absolute positions in CSS to create a cool scrolling effect, and a few more things as well. I attempted to create my own animations instead of using a library (Using jQuery instead of hover.css). I feel that I did an okay job and that the website showcases Hansteartist's work nicely.</p>
