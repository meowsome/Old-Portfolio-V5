            <p>This website is a replication of an older version of my personal website, but with different content. Its design is very basic because I was still learning how to build an independent website. It was the first site I experimented with CSS animations, which you can see throughout the website. This was the first site I ever built solely on GitHub instead of Tumblr to host the code (even though I didn't fully utilize Github's features).</p>
