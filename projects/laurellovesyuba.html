            <p>This was my second website that I had created as a request! I attempted to make the website easy and fun to use with CSS animations. I applied my previous knowledge to the site, as well as new things that I learned. In the creation of this site, I began to learn some more capabilities of Github, such as script and image hosting. I learned some new things about CSS animations as well, which you can see throughout the site. Overall, I feel that the website is alright and showcases LaurelLovesYuba's work well.</p>
