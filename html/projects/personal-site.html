            <p class="subtitle"><i>This is yet another re-code of my personal website. I used all of the latest knowledge that I have gained in the past.</i></p><br>
            <p>This website is the fifth version of my portfolio website. It contains the most up-to-date coding knowledge that I have. Some things that I learned while developing the website were how to include other pages elsewhere in one main index page, how to effectively use a single color scheme and branding throughout a site, how to include icons in a site using multiple different sources, how to effectively use flexbox in CSS, and so much more. I replicated many aspects of Google's Material Design in this website, which you can see throughout it. I feel that no website can ever be perfect, but I am very pleased with the results of this one.</p>
